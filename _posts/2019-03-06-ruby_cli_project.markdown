I have been brainstorming of different ideas for my Ruby CLI project. I came up with scraping a florist website. 

First the user will be given a choice of price ranges that they can choose from. Once they choose one, I will give them a list of flowers in that price range and how much each one costs. Then they could select the flower they like and I will give them the url to order that flower. 

Different methods I will definately need:
- scraping method to get all the names, prices, and urls
- hash that gets all the flowers and puts them in arrays depending on their price range
- user input for asking them the category and to select a flower
- different greetings for the user 
- I will also need to create a way for the different classes to interact with each other

As I am working on my project, I will most probably need more, but this is a good start. 

Method of working:
I want to start with scraping my website, then add psudeocode to the methods, and then at the end plug in the real code. I think this method will work out best because if I could get my program working on its own with hardcode, I will have an easier time isolating the errors with real code.
