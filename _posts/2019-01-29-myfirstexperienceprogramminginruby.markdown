I started Flatiron a few weeks ago, curious about programming. I had some experience coding with HTML and CSS, and dabbled a little with JavaScript, but nothing major. So far I've really been enjoying! I love coding and using my brain, trying to figure out how to solve each lesson. I've been taking advantage of the various study groups on all different topics, and have impressed myself in how much I've gained and my ability to problem solve. I never realized how much I enjoy working with logic. 
Last week I joined a coding challenge study group. I was able to use all my (newly acquired) knowledge to solve the code wars! I felt very proud, not only because I've gained so much, but also since I was able to apply what I've learned to other things as well.  I can't wait to learn more!
